# Churn Analysis

A data analysis project focused on exploring customer churn behavior and building insights and predictive models to understand what drives customers to leave a business. This repository includes exploratory analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling for churn.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn—also known as customer attrition—refers to customers stopping their relationship with a business or service. Understanding and predicting churn helps organizations improve retention and profitability. This project analyzes churn data, performs data exploration, builds predictive models, and summarizes factors influencing churn.

## 📊 Key Features

### 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis

* Analyze customer attributes, tenure, account details, and their relationship with churn.
* Visualizations to understand trends and patterns.
* Detect missing values, distributions, and correlations.

### 📈 Predictive Modeling

* Train and evaluate classification models to predict customer churn.
* Handle preprocessing steps such as encoding and scaling.
* Compare performance across multiple models.

### 🔍 Metrics and Evaluation

* Models evaluated using metrics like:
  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * ROC-AUC
  * F1-Score

* Best performing models identified and interpreted.

## 📌 Notes

- The main analysis is contained in the Jupyter Notebook (`churn.ipynb`)
- Large dataset files such as `.csv` and `.xlsx` are included for local exploration
- If Power BI files (`.pbix`) are included, their usage should be documented separately
